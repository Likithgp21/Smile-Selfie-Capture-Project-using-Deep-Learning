Smile Selfie Capture Project using Deep Learning
📘 Project Overview

The Smile Selfie Capture Project uses deep learning to automatically detect smiles and capture selfies. By leveraging facial recognition and smile classification techniques, the system activates the camera shutter only when a smile is detected, ensuring a perfect selfie every time.

🚀 Features

Smile Detection: The system uses deep learning algorithms to detect smiles in real-time.

Selfie Capture: Automatically triggers the camera to capture a selfie when a smile is detected.

Facial Landmark Detection: The model identifies key facial features to detect a smile accurately.

Real-Time Processing: Utilizes computer vision techniques to ensure immediate feedback for capturing the perfect selfie.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for smile detection.

Libraries:

TensorFlow or Keras for building deep learning models.

OpenCV for image processing and real-time facial detection.

dlib for facial landmark detection.

Python: Main programming language for building and training the model.
